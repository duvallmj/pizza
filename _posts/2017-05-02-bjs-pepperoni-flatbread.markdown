I went out to lunch with some co-workers to see off a colleage moving on to better things (RIP) so I decided to get the Pepperoni Extreme Flatbread -- well I got the half of one that comes on their lunch menu. They definitely got the pepperoni extreme name right because it comes with maybe too much pepperoni -- it has regular pepperoni, diced pepperoni, and julienned pepperoni. Combine that with the fact that it's on a flatbread pizza and you've got a pretty inflated pepperoni : rest of the pizza ratio. It was good of course but I think I prefer the mini deep dish pizza if I was gonna get sometihng with that many toppings. Something a little lighter on the flatbread would be pretty good though.

I didn't think to take a picture of it until too late though, my bad.
