Hey everybody, tried the new Spicy Sicilian pizza from Newk's. It was pretty good. It's got a bunch of spicy italian meats on it that are all pretty good. It also has green onions and capers which I don't particularly like but it didn't really take away from the pizza. I would definitely get this one again.
